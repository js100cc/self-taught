# Self-taught programmer, on the way

This repo record my learning.

My main purpose is to become a web developer.

English is not my mother tongue, many markdown and some code comments may written in Chinese(中文).

## Main programming languages

I love JS the most.

As a self-taught guy, i tried many languages like c/java/python/scheme... to get a feeling about how programming is. But i never learn them very hard.

JS is my choice. i'm learning it very hard. Not professional, but confident.

As a result, i also learn some html and css and web API as they are main interfaces for js.

Sometimes, i still have a desire to learn other languages. Recently i narrow it down to focusing Rust.

## Learning strategy

I alreay have some experience, i wish to keep it going.

1. Persistence. I think it's the most important thing.
2. Don't rush. Learn the basics first.
3. Practice. Not only basic feature and API，but also do projects no matter how tiny there are.
4. Focus.

## Short-term plan

Find a developer job. Maybe in three months from now.

## Long-term plan

I really like computer stuff, a web developer job is not final target.

I made my own desktop PC from components, i use Arch Linux as my OS, i use Vim as my editor ...

Due to real-life issues, It's true that i give up learning programming many times, i also lost myself for long.

But what i know about meself is, deeply inside my heart, i could be a useful person, i must be, and do it with programming.
